* Providers
** Client

Platform services is in charge for managing the eco system around the user and the game.
Such as in game currency, leaderbords, matchmaking and stuff.

- Firebase
Just a framework for managing the user base.
- Parse
Equal to firebase.
- Chilli Connect
Ready to use. Seems feature rich, has integration with Photon. Monitization support.
https://docs.chilliconnect.com/guide/
- App42
Ready to use. Seems widely adopted. Not as feature rich as chilli connect?
http://api.shephertz.com/
- Bespoke
Might just work.
- PlayFab
Good integration with Photon if thats considered.

*** Game servers
I need to find some information and ref architecture on how to implement logic in the gameserver.
What to place where etc. This might simplify the decision making.

- Photon
A one stop shop. Seems quite adopted, however it might not scale well due to the pricing model.
The problem with pomelo might be the room design. However this is a problem never the less.
We need to figure out how to handle the open world part. Seperate global chat with game rooms?

- UE4

- Pomelo
Seems nice. Written in Nodejs. No updates since early/mid 2017 though which is a bit worrying.

- Unity multiplayer
Old one deprecated, waiting for the new one to be released.

- KBengine
Seems really good, and is under active development. However its chinese, and much
documentation/community is not english speaking.
https://github.com/kbengine/kbengine
- Nano
https://github.com/lonng/nano
- Lance
Might be possible to use only the backend? Might be hard to use in
conjunction with unity.

** Backend
** Infrastructure
*** Google cloud
Possibility to use k8s and https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agones/ to manage the game servers.
*** AWS
Possibility to use GameLift as a more managed infrastrucutre. Seems to be limited to session based games though?
